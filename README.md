# PeerVault

A distributed peer-to-peer file storage system built in Go with encryption, automatic replication, and comprehensive monitoring. PeerVault is a production-ready, decentralized file storage system designed for secure and resilient data distribution across peer-to-peer networks. Built entirely in Go with zero external dependencies, it provides enterprise-grade features in a lightweight, easy-to-deploy package.

### What is PeerVault?

At its core, PeerVault creates a distributed storage network where files are automatically replicated across multiple nodes. When you store a file on any node, it's immediately encrypted with AES-256 encryption and propagated to all connected peers. This ensures your data remains available even if individual nodes go offline or fail.

### How It Works

1. **Content-Addressable Storage**: Files are identified by their SHA-256 hash, ensuring data integrity and deduplication
2. **Automatic Replication**: When a file is stored, it's broadcast to all connected peers who automatically fetch and store it
3. **Peer Discovery**: Nodes can find each other through manual bootstrap configuration, local network discovery (mDNS), or peer exchange (PEX)
4. **Encryption Layer**: All files are encrypted before storage and network transmission, ensuring data privacy
5. **Streaming Architecture**: Files are transferred using streaming I/O, allowing efficient handling of files of any size with constant memory usage

### Use Cases

PeerVault is ideal for scenarios requiring distributed, fault-tolerant storage:

- **Distributed Backup Systems**: Replicate critical data across multiple geographic locations with automatic integrity verification
- **Edge Computing**: Store data close to edge nodes for low-latency access with built-in monitoring
- **Development & CI/CD**: Share build artifacts across distributed build nodes with automatic cleanup
- **Content Distribution**: Create CDN-like networks for media distribution with bandwidth tracking
- **Collaborative Workflows**: Share files across distributed teams with real-time replication

## Key Features

### Core Storage & Security

- **Distributed Storage**: Files are automatically replicated across all connected peer nodes in real-time. When you store a file on one node, it's immediately broadcast to the network, ensuring redundancy and high availability. Even if multiple nodes fail, your data remains accessible from surviving peers.

- **AES-256 Encryption**: Industry-standard encryption protects your data at rest and in transit. Every file is encrypted before being written to disk or sent over the network. Configurable encryption keys ensure you maintain full control over your data security.

- **Content-Addressable Storage (CAS)**: Files are organized and identified by their SHA-256 hash, creating a tamper-proof storage system. This approach enables automatic deduplication, ensures data integrity, and allows for efficient file retrieval across the network.

### Network & Discovery

- **Flexible Peer Discovery**: Multiple discovery mechanisms ensure nodes can find each other in any environment:
  - **Manual Bootstrap**: Traditional approach for internet-deployed nodes
  - **mDNS Local Discovery**: Zero-configuration automatic discovery on local networks
  - **Peer Exchange (PEX)**: Gossip-based protocol where nodes learn about peers from their existing connections, enabling organic network growth

- **Resilient Networking**: Built-in auto-reconnection, configurable timeouts, and retry mechanisms ensure stable connections. Supports NAT traversal with separate listen and advertise addresses for complex network topologies.

### Resource Management

- **Storage Quotas**: Prevent disk space exhaustion with configurable storage limits. Interactive quota setup on first run, real-time usage tracking, and smart cleanup prompts when approaching limits. Quotas are enforced before accepting new files, ensuring predictable resource usage.

- **Garbage Collection**: Automated background process runs hourly to verify file integrity by recalculating SHA-256 hashes. Automatically removes corrupted files and orphaned data, maintaining storage health without manual intervention.

- **Streaming I/O**: Memory-efficient architecture uses streaming for all file operations. Transfer files of any size while using only ~32KB of memory per operation, making PeerVault suitable for resource-constrained environments.

### Monitoring & Observability

- **Prometheus Metrics**: Comprehensive metrics tracking for production deployments:
  - File operations (stored, retrieved, deleted)
  - Network statistics (bytes sent/received, peer connections)
  - Storage utilization (used, total, percentage)
  - System health (errors, uptime)

  Metrics available in Prometheus, JSON, and human-readable formats via HTTP endpoints.

- **Health Checks**: Built-in peer health monitoring tracks last-seen timestamps and connection status. Automatic detection of stale or disconnected peers helps maintain network health.
