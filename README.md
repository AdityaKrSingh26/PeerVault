# PeerVault

PeerVault is a **P2P distributed file storage system** that allows you to store and retrieve files across a distributed network of nodes. It uses encryption to secure your files and ensures redundancy by broadcasting files to multiple peers in the network and makes sure theyâ€™re available even if one computer goes offline.

---

## What It Does

- **Distributed File Storage**: Files are stored across multiple nodes in the network.
- **Encryption**: Files are encrypted before being stored and decrypted when retrieved.
- **Streaming Support**: Handles large files efficiently using streaming.
- **Custom Protocol**: Uses a lightweight custom protocol for communication between nodes.
- **Peer Discovery**: Automatically connects to other nodes in the network for redundancy.

## How to Use

### 1. Install
1. Download the project:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AdityaKrSingh26/PeerVault.git
   cd PeerVault
   ```

2. Build the project:
   ```bash
   make build
   ```

### 2. Run
Start a node:
```bash
./bin/fs -addr :3000
```

### 3. Store a File
Store a file like this:
```go
data := bytes.NewReader([]byte("Hello, PeerVault!"))
fileServer.Store("myfile.txt", data)
```

### 4. Get a File
Retrieve a file like this:
```go
reader, err := fileServer.Get("myfile.txt")
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
data, _ := ioutil.ReadAll(reader)
fmt.Println(string(data)) // Output: Hello, PeerVault!
```

## Example

1. Start the first computer:
   ```bash
   ./bin/fs -addr :3000
   ```

2. Start the second computer:
   ```bash
   ./bin/fs -addr :7000
   ```

3. Start the third computer and connect to the first two:
   ```bash
   ./bin/fs -addr :5000 -bootstrap :3000,:7000
   ```

Now, you can store and retrieve files across all three computers!
